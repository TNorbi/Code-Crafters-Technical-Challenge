Technical Challenge

## The problem

Write a solution in c# that can generate a one-time password. The input should be the following two pieces information: User Id and Date time. Every generated password should be valid for up to 30 seconds.
You are free to use a Web, API, Console or Class Library project in order to accomplish the requirement.

## Project

The project that I made for this problem is a Web Application made in Blazor, which communicates with an API that I also made using ASP.NET Core Web API, the database used for this project was MS SQL Server.
In order to run this project you need to run the two applications (WebApp and API) at the same time or it's enough if you run only the API application.
